## Captain Of Cheats Mod

A modding tool for Captain of Industry. It has a cheat menu that can be accessed via the F8 key or by clicking the right-most ship wheel icon on your bottom toolbar.

Cheats
- Spawn any haulable product into your shipyard at specified quantities
- Turn any storage building into an infinite provider or deleter of products using the storage god mode tool (in your tools menu). WARNING: Use of god mode creates products from nothing and breaks how the game internally tracks recycling. So you may find recycling does not produce the output you expect if your production chains use God Mode.

## Installation
1. Download the mod zip file from the GitHub Release that cooresponds to your Captain Of Industry game version (it will be named like "CaptainOfCheats_vX.X.X.zip where the X's are replaced by the version of the release"). If a release does not exist for your game version, using an another version may fail to load properly.
2. Extract the zip file to the `%APPDATA%\Captain of Industry\Mods` directory.
3. The extracted zip should result in a directory structure like `%APPDATA%\Captain of Industry\Mods\CaptainOfCheats\CaptainOfCheats.dll`. Fix your directory structure to look like this if it does not for any reason.
5. Enable modding in the game settings under the Miscellaneous tab > Modding toggle button

## Disclaimers 
The game is in early access and is being patched often. Patches have and will likely continue to break the mod so please check the game version mentioned in the release you are using. Updates to patches will be created as time permits. 

Disable automatic game updates and only update when a new mod version is released if you want to keep it working during these patches. 

Additionally, no warranty is provided that this will not cause you issues in your game. You assume any and all risk by using this mod in your game.

## Modders
Please be cautious copying some of the patterns in use by this code, it in some cases purposefully bypasses access restrictions setup by the developers via reflection and is most certainly not a 'best practice' for other modders to copy. In some cases there may be other, less brittle approaches to implement similar functionality. I've made these decisions willingly and have increased maintenance burden or bugs as a result.
